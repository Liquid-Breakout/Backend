## :warning: This is a W.I.P. project! :warning:
This is a reimplementation of LB's Backend, made in Rust.
## Why Rust? Node.js was fine.
Yeah.............. except it's RAM-consuming, slow, and the toolings just aifhaiuwfhwafa.
Rust, while yes it's pretty low-level, guarantees memory-safety and I have heard it can handle more requests, so there's that.
## How can I contribute?
While I know the team isn't capable of doing Rust things, you can at least help me test out, suggest features. And stuffs.
